## Description 
Truck safe is a React APP that makes use of Googles Developer Tools to create a Company focused Web Application for trucking and delivery companies to organise delieries. Management Users can create job listings and delegate them to avaliable drivers. Being a MERN Stack application, the data is stored on a database and retrieved when needed in the application. This Application's stand out feature is being able to track the live or last known location of a driver to ensure the driver is taking the appropriate breaks and is sticking to the speed limit, without the installation of any hardware.
